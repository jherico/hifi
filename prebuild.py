# The prebuild script is intended to simplify life for developers and dev-ops.  It's repsonsible for acquiring 
# tools required by the build as well as dependencies on which we rely.  
# 
# By using this script, we can reduce the requirements for a developer getting started to:
#
# * A working C++ dev environment like visual studio, xcode, gcc, or clang
# * Qt 
# * CMake
# * Python 3.x
#
# The function of the build script is to acquire, if not already present, all the other build requirements
# The build script should be idempotent.  If you run it with the same arguments multiple times, that should 
# have no negative impact on the subsequent build times (i.e. re-running the prebuild script should not 
# trigger a header change that causes files to be rebuilt).  Subsequent runs after the first run should 
# execute quickly, determining that no work is to be done
